# README Images Directory

This directory is dedicated to storing images used in the project's README documentation.

## Guidelines for Adding Images

- Use descriptive filenames that reflect the content (e.g., `vhs-interface-demo.png`)
- Optimize images for web viewing before adding
- Recommended formats: PNG for screenshots/UI, JPG for photos
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB when possible)

## Usage in README

To reference images in the README.md, use relative paths:

```markdown
![Description](/docs/images/your-image.png)
```

## Categories

Organize images in appropriate categories:
- Interface screenshots
- Feature demonstrations
- Architecture diagrams
- Logo and branding assets
